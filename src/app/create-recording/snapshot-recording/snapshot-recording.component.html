<div class="description">
  A Snapshot recording is one which contains all information about all events
that have been captured in the current session by <i>other</i> non-snapshot
recordings. Snapshots do not themselves define which events are enabled, their
thresholds, or any other options. A Snapshot is only ever in the STOPPED state
from the moment it is created.
